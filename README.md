# Breast-Cancer-Project
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the world. Early detection of breast cancer is essential in reducing their life losses.
The tumor is classified in two, Benign (Non-Cancerous Cell) and Malignant (Cancerous Cell).
The aim of the project was to classify the above respective tumors by building predective models using Machine learning algorithms in Python. 
According to the Problem Statement the main focus of project was to apply KNN algorithm and find the optimal k-value giving highest accuracy value.
Other ML Algorithms such as Logistics, SVM, Decision Tree were applied for classification of tissue as Cancerous or Non-Cancerous.
The models were evaluated on metrics such Confusion_matrix, Accuracy_Score and Classification_report giving in-detail report of the respective models.
The finding for KNN model was as follow, the optimal K-value was K=9 giving the lowest misclassification error, highest accuracy and highest AUC.
Among the other models Logistics Model performed the best giving highest accuracy score and proper recall values for both the classes.
Hence successfully classified the tumor into Benign and Malignant with minimum errors for entire data.
